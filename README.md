# Call Centre Dashboard

## Overview

This project involves the creation of an interactive **Call Centre Dashboard**, designed to track key performance indicators (KPIs) and provide insights into call centre operations. The dashboard includes detailed visualizations that focus on call volume, response times, call duration, reasons for customer interactions, sentiment analysis, and more. It is an essential tool for monitoring performance and improving customer service operations.

The dashboard is built with **[POWER BI]** and includes multiple views for quick insights, such as a grid for detailed call logs and a home view summarizing key metrics.

## Key Features

- **Total Calls**: Displays the total number of calls received in a given period.
- **Call Duration**: Shows the total duration of calls both in hours and minutes, helping to identify areas where efficiency can be improved.
- **Call Activity by Day**: Provides a bar chart showing the number of calls each day, revealing trends and peaks.
- **Call Volume by State**: Geographic breakdown of call volume, highlighting regions with the highest customer interaction.
- **Call Reason Insights**: Visual representation of the most common reasons customers call, such as Billing Questions, Service Outages, and Payments.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Shows the sentiment of the calls (Negative, Neutral, Positive), giving insight into the customer experience.
- **Call Centre Distribution**: Displays call volumes per call centre location, helping to identify regions with higher call loads.
- **Response Time & SLA**: Monitors whether calls are within the Service Level Agreement (SLA) and tracks overall performance.

## Key Insights

### Home Dashboard Insights
1. **Total Calls and Duration**: 32.94K calls, totaling 13.74K hours of customer interaction.
2. **Call Volume by Day**: The call volume spikes towards the end of the week, particularly on **Thursday** and **Friday**.
3. **Call Volume by State**: Certain regions (identified in the geographical map) experience higher call volumes, highlighting regional support challenges.
4. **Most Frequent Call Reasons**: 
   - **Billing Questions**: 23.46K calls.
   - **Payments and Service Outages**: 4.7K calls each.
5. **Sentiment Distribution**: A large portion of calls have **Negative Sentiment** (11.1K), indicating areas where customer service can be improved.

### Grid Dashboard Insights
1. **Response Time Analysis**: 75.26% of calls are handled within SLA, but some calls exceed SLA, particularly for billing-related issues.
2. **Call Duration Consistency**: Most calls have a **45-minute** duration, reflecting a standard handling time across calls, which may suggest room for process optimization.
3. **Call Centres and City Data**: The distribution of calls across cities (e.g., **Los Angeles** with 14K calls) helps identify resource allocation needs for different locations.
